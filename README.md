# Proposal Index

##### About this repository
* This repo is just a container for an `index.html` file on the `gh-pages` branch 
* The [proposal index](http://dashcommunity.github.io/proposals/) displays links to project proposals, past and present.
* All actual proposals live in their own respective repositories so that they can host their own [Github Project Page](https://pages.github.com/)

This page should be be updated

1. when a proposal is added to the community
2. monthly to archive expired proposals
