# Proposal Index

##### About this repository
* This repo is just a container for an index.html that displays links to project proposals, past and present.
* All proposals should live in their own respective repositories so that they can host their own [Github Project Page](https://pages.github.com/)

This page should be be updated

1. when a proposal is added to the community
2. monthly to archive expired proposals
